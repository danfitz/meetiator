# Meetiator

Mediates your meetings via a note-taking user interface. When the meeting ends, you and your team walk away with a print-out or PDF for increased accountability and clarity.

## How it Works

1. Start by setting the time you expect or want the meeting to last. Meetiator displays a quiet countdown timer to help keep you on track.
2. Input your meeting title or guiding topic question. It will show up as a header at the top of your dynamically generated page.
3. Add all the people involved in your meeting.
4. Press the **+** icon to start adding.
5. You can create tasks. Tasks can be assigned to a person, and they can be given a due date.
6. You can create takeaway questions, which can also be assigned and dated.
7. Finally, you can create flags, adding a ribbon at the top for information you want to flag during your meeting.
